        Giler and Hill revised and made additions to the script; Shusett was executive producer.
        The Alien and its accompanying artifacts were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the more human settings.

        It also launched Weaver\'s acting career, providing her with her first lead role.
        The story of her character\'s encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic and narrative core of the sequels
